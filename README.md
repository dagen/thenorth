# The North
This is a personal project in which I will be learning how to use Salt as a configuration management tool.

'The North' is a nod to one of my favorite book series, _Game of Thrones_. I have created a local dev/testing environment on my laptop using VMWare Fusion virtual machines.  There are two hosts there named:

- winterfell.dgentry.local : This host will act as a Vault Server and a Salt Master.
- karhold.dgentry.local : This host will act as a Salt Minion

## Usage
This repository will be cloned down to the 'winterfell' host and used to perform configuration management tasks on the 'karhold' host.
